# Iris Dataset Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Iris_dataset.ipynb`) that explores and analyzes the classic Iris dataset. The notebook includes data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to classify the different species of the Iris flower.

## Contents

- **`Iris_dataset.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing all analyses and code.
  
## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Model evaluation and accuracy metrics

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following attributes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
